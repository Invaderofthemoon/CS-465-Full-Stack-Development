Using the express stack and single page application(SPA) for this project was challenging and a new experience. Express was simple to understand for the initial set-up, and adding different layouts and looks was interesting to do. After debugging and testing, the interaction between mongoDB and the backend worked flawlessly. Setting up the security and endpoints was challenging, Im not sure if all the packages were up to date, but is something I need to work on and improve. The UX adn UI personally is better when using SPA. It feels modern and cleaner rather than tradional HTML. This course has taught me a lot in front end and back end responsibilities. I will take this course and improve on my skills.
